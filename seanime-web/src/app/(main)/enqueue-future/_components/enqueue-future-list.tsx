/**
 * Gathers a franchise into one bundle wherever its members turn up, and draws a spine around it.
 *
 * A family is placed at its *earliest* member — the slot that franchise already held — and every
 * later member is spliced up into it rather than left stranded further down. A season discovered
 * mid-run therefore joins its siblings instead of landing at the bottom of a list of hundreds, and a
 * row that was alone becomes a group the moment a relative shows up behind it.
 *
 * The cost is that splicing a member up pushes the rows between it and its family down by one. That
 * only happens on the poll that discovers a relative of something already queued, and only for rows
 * below the family's slot — everything above it, including the whole stretch you have already worked
 * through, is untouched.
 *
 * Degrouping is free: when the rest of a bundle is matched, skipped or ignored, the survivor is a
 * bundle of one, so it loses the spine and header and keeps the slot it already had.
 *
 * Each entry appears exactly once in the result, so flattening it is a reordering of the input and
 * never a duplication — which is what lets the list and Next/Previous agree on the same order.
