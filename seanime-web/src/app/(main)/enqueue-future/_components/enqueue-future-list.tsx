/**
 * Draws a spine around franchise members that are *already adjacent*. Pure decoration — it takes the
 * order it is given and hands it back untouched.
 *
 * The caller freezes the order so that a row, once placed, keeps its slot (see the page container).
 * Gathering scattered members would undo that in one stroke: lifting a season up to join its siblings
 * pushes every row between them down, and a run discovering anime behind you does that over and over.
 * A franchise being adjacent is not worth the list moving while you work down it — and the server
 * already walks a family to its end before the next spread of recommendations, so members usually
 * arrive together and get their spine anyway.
 *
 * Degrouping is free: when the rest of a bundle is matched, skipped or ignored, the survivor is a
 * bundle of one, so it loses the spine and header and keeps the slot it already had.
 *
 * Flattening the result returns the input, which is what lets the list and Next/Previous agree.
